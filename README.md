# Tasit

Tasit Labs makes mobile Ethereum dapps.

Tasit Labs has two major projects that dovetail together: the [Tasit SDK](https://github.com/tasitlabs/tasitsdk) (for developers) and the [Tasit mobile apps](https://github.com/tasitlabs/tasit) (for pretty much anyone who uses a smartphone).

The Tasit SDK is a JavaScript SDK for making mobile Ethereum dapps using React Native, and Tasit is a suite of mobile apps for mainstream users that lets them use popular dapps.
