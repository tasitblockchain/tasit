# Tasit

Tasit Labs makes mobile apps for Ethereum dapps.

Tasit Labs has two major projects that dovetail together: the Tasit SDK (for developers) and the Tasit mobile apps (for pretty much anyone who uses a smartphone).

The Tasit SDK is a JavaScript SDK for making mobile apps for Ethereum dapps using React Native, and Tasit is a suite of mobile apps for mainstream users that lets them use popular dapps.
